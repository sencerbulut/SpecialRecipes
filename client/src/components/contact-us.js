We started this project with the aim of revealing the recipes that remain completely hidden. While doing this, we also aimed to enable people to experience these recipes at home. As a team we gave the opportunity to rate and share these recipes according to their taste. Within the scope of this project, we also aimed to provide a passive income to housewives. We hope that this project will contribute to the unveiling of the hidden recipes!
